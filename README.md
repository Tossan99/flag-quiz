## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted to choose one color that goes well with red and green since those colors indicate if you have answered right or wrong in the quiz. The choice was hard but it came down to blue.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

I have chosen to use the REM font in bold format since it stands out among all the bright colors and is easy to read.

### Wireframes

One Wireframe was created for desktop using [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

### Favicon

The page have a simple favicon of a blue flag

### Logo

The logo is centered in the top of the page above the main container that contains all other content. It's in big bold font so it stands out among the bright colors.

### Question

This section displays a random flag and the question "Which country does this flag belong to?" 

![Question Section](assets/readme-images/flag-quiz-question.jpg)

### Timer

The timer counts down from 10 seconds and resets every time the next button is clicked and a new question is displayed. If the user doesn't click any of the answer buttons before the timer goes to 0 the next question will be displayed and the user miss the chance to score a point on the question skipped.

### Question Counter

The question counter displays which question the user is currently on.

### End Section

The end section is displayed after the user has answered all questions and clicked the "Check Score" button. The section displays how many questions the user answered right on and displays the "Restart!" button that restarts the quiz.

### Features Left to Implement

- Score message 
   - I would like to make the message in the end change depending on how good the user answered on the questions.

- Highscore
    - I would like to add a highscore section to the end page.

- Accessible to visually impaired users
    - I would like to implement alt texts for all flags that describes the flags so visually impaired users could also enjoy this quiz.

### Accessibility

This website is unfortunately not very accessible to visually impaired users since the goal of the quiz is to recognize what the different flags looks like and there is no alt text to describe them since it was to hard to implement.

With that said the website is still designed to have a sufficient color contrast throughout the site.
